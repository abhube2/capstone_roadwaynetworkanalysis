# capstone_roadwaynetworkanalysis

### Purpose of this Project
This presentation investigates the root causes of roadway accidents on the East End Crossing project and pinpoints the roadside assets that are struck most often.

The goal is to guide proactive stocking, targeted maintenance, and low-cost safety counter measures.

###Technologies Used
The project is presented in Power BI using a variety of visualizations that include maps, slicers, bar charts, matrix tables, etc. Cross-report relationships are common among many of these tools and Canva was used on one slide as well. 

In addition to Power BI, Python was utilized to create an interactive map for analysis. The map shows the friction data from various years with annual crash locations similarly layered on top. Each crash is represented by a black dot; hovering over a specific dot displays useful information such as collision date, time, primary factors leading to the crash, the manner in which the crash happened, the condition of the pavement surface and the weather at that time. The python map was replicated in the presentation using a Microsoft Azure map.

Finally, all data was cleaned, reviewed and otherwise managed in Microsoft Excel. These files can be found in the GitHub associated with this presentation.

###Interacting with Project Tools
The Power BI file titled “ABH Capstone_Roadway Analysis” is the primary platform the presentation should be viewed. If the user would like additional flexibility in their exploration, they can open the html file called “crash_friction_map”. Should anyone have interest in reviewing the code supporting this html file it has been included as “Roadway Analysis_Final”.

###Data Sources
Data was acquired from three entities. Friction data is produced annually from a consultant, Applied Research Associates (ARA), at the request of East End Crossing Partners. Crash information was received from the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT). INDOT is one of many stakeholders and the client representative for the project. Information related to damaged assets was produced internally from East End Crossing Partner’s asset management system.
