# capstone_roadwaynetworkanalysis

### Purpose of this Project
This presentation investigates the root causes of roadway accidents on the East End Crossing Project and pin?points the roadside assets that are struck most often.
The goal is to guide proactive stocking, targeted maintenance, and low cost safety counter measures for the next O&M cycle.

###Technologies Used
The project is presented in Power BI using a variety of visualizations that include maps, slicers, bar charts, matrix tables, etc. Cross-report relationships are common among many of these tools and Canva was used on one slide as well. 

In addition to Power BI, Python was utilized to create an interactive map for analysis. The map shows the friction data from various years with annual crash locations similarly layered on top. Each crash is represented by a black dot; hovering over a specific dot displays useful information such as collision date, time, primary factors leading to the crash, the manner in which the crash happened, the condition of the pavement surface and the weather at that time. The python map was replicated in the presentation using a Microsoft Azure map.

###Interacting with Project Tools
The Power BI file titled “ABH Capstone_Roadway Analysis” is the primary platform the presentation should be viewed. If the user would like additional flexibility in their exploration, they can open the html file called “crash_friction_map”. Should anyone have interest in reviewing the code supporting this html file it has been included as “Roadway Analysis_Final”
